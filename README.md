# 🌐 React SPA Routing Lab — Experiments 1–4

This project demonstrates **client-side routing in a Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React Router DOM**. It combines four routing experiments into one working React app.

The application supports navigation between multiple pages without browser reload and includes fallback routing for invalid URLs.

## ▶️ How It Works

* `BrowserRouter` wraps the app
* `Routes` contains route definitions
* Each `Route` maps a path to a component
* `Link` enables navigation without reload
* `*` route handles undefined URLs
